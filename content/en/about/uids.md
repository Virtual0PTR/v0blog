# Nickname evolution（
> FPSPing(The origin is long gone and cannot be traced)   
> -> FPSPinging(Simple repetition)   
> -> FPSWatercat(Watercat is a liquid cat，[超级小树](https://space.bilibili.com/22263760))   
> zerostart(Brush to [Undisputed Vocaloid P Ranking](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LY4y1g7FE),I once thought of being a P-master, so I "deliberately found faults, the first letter must be Z", and then I thought of a word starting with Z, "zero". In order to appear positive, I added "start", and the Chinese translation is also better (although I didn't use it))   
> -> zerostartuser,zerostartroot(it goes without saying)   
> ->-> zerosrp(The first domain name, "start" was shortened to "sr", and the "p" of "Producer" was added.)   
> ->-> zerostartsrp(it goes without saying)   
> ->->-> zeroPTR(Do you believe me when I say srp and ptr are very similar? At the same time, ptr has practical meaning, which is better than the confusing suffix srp.)   
> ->->->-> PTRZERO(Write zeroPTR in reverse)   
> ->->->-> 0x00PTR(Replace zero with 0x00)   
> ->->->->-> 0x00505452(0x00 combined with 'P' 'T' 'R' in ascii hexadecimal)   
> ->->->->-> z0x00PTR(Since the name of xx cannot start with a number, add "zero" 'z')   
> ->->->->-> 0xptr(0x00PTR abbreviation)
